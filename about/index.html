    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Crystal, and I am a third-year international business major at the University of California, San Diego. Doing a double minor in Cognitive Science & Marketing. As you can tell, my life is centered around the business world with a few side missions. Growing up in a small city near Ontario, CA, I have always envisioned myself in an office working on endless projects that grant me creativity and freedom to reach targeted audiences.</p>

    <p>You can find me at Geisel Library studying or talking with my fellow hermanas from HaU. Other times, I'm right back home with my friends who have been with me since high school. I enjoy being home with my tiny dog, Pily, who so happens to be very judgmental of outsiders. Or spending time with my partner and friends, who let me let loose and embrace the good moments.</p>

    <p>I'm happy with where I am in life, and all of the trials or tribulations I have encountered are all for a reason. I'm optimistic, passionate, and secure in my work and skills, but I'm also someone who likes a challenge, no matter how big or small it may be. Utilizing my skills in work environments or educational settings allows me to practice and deepen my skills to benefit my future.</p>
